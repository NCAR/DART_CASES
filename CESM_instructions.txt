Time to check the case.

1)  Scan the output from this setup script for errors and warnings:
    ERROR, WARNING, 'No such file' (except for MOSART)
    'File status unknown' can be ignored.
    'ERROR: cice.buildlib failed' can be ignored, unless you've changed the CICE code

2)  cd /glade/scratch/raeder/f.e21.FHIST_BGC.f09_025.CAM6assim.011/run
    Check the files that were staged; follow the links to confirm the data sources.
    Check the compatibility between them and the namelists and pointer files.

3)  cd /glade/work/raeder/Exp/f.e21.FHIST_BGC.f09_025.CAM6assim.011
    Verify the CESM XML settings, especially in env_batch.xml and env_run.xml.
    ./xmlquery --partial <partial_string_of_interest> 
    is particularly useful.

4)  The default initial configuration is to assimilate.
    Verify the /glade/work/raeder/Exp/f.e21.FHIST_BGC.f09_025.CAM6assim.011/input.nml contents.
    Assimilation can be turned off by
    ./xmlchange DATA_ASSIMILATION_SCRIPT=/glade/work/raeder/Exp/f.e21.FHIST_BGC.f09_025.CAM6assim.011/no_assimilate.csh
    DART can be turned off by
    ./xmlchange DATA_ASSIMILATION=FALSE

5)  Submit the job (and get mail when it starts and stops):
    ./case.submit -M begin,end

6)  After the job has run, check to make sure it worked.

7)  If the first cycle generated an ensemble by perturbing a single state,
    change input.nml as described in the instructions in it,
    to make cycles 2,...,N use the latest ensemble, unperturbed.

8)  To extend the run in 6 'nhours' steps, use xmlchange to
    change the CESM runtime variables:

    ./xmlchange DATA_ASSIMILATION_CYCLES= the value you want.
    ./xmlchange CONTINUE_RUN=TRUE
    ./xmlchange RESUBMIT= the number of JOBS to run (each JOB performs DATA_ASSIMILATION_CYCLES cycles)
