Check the DART configuration:

1) The default behavior setup_hybrid is too not run DART_config, which sets up assimilation.
   The default behavior of setup_advanced is to invoke DART_config. 

2) If you want to turn DART on or off, edit the 
   env_run.xml: DATA_ASSIMILATION_* to specify which DART script 
   to use after the model forecast;
   assimilate.csh, no_assimilate.csh, or perfect_model.csh.

3) Modify what you need to in the DART namelist file, i.e. 
   /glade/work/raeder/Exp/f.e21.FHIST_BGC.f09_025.CAM6assim.011/input.nml

4) If you have recompiled any part of the DART system, 'stage_dart_files'
   will copy them into the correct places.

5) If you stage your own inflation files, make sure you read the "INFLATION" section
   in /glade/work/raeder/Exp/f.e21.FHIST_BGC.f09_025.CAM6assim.011/assimilate.csh.  
   At the very least, copy your inflation files
   in /glade/scratch/raeder/f.e21.FHIST_BGC.f09_025.CAM6assim.011/run 
   into the appropriate names:
      input_priorinf_mean.nc
      input_priorinf_sd.nc
      input_postinf_mean.nc 
      input_postinf_sd.nc   
   If assimilate.csh does not find inflation files, it will call fill_inflation_restart
   to create some from the inflation values in input.nml.

6) Make sure the observation directory name in assimilate.csh or perfect_model.csh 
   matches the one on your system.

7) Submit the CESM job in the normal way.

8) You can use /glade/work/raeder/Exp/f.e21.FHIST_BGC.f09_025.CAM6assim.011/stage_cesm_files 
   to stage an ensemble of files to restart a run at a date for which you have a restart set.
